# Cloud Native Telco Forum

Cloud Native Telco Forum (CNTF) is a group of eager Operators and ISVs to accelerate the cloud native transformation journey in telecommunications.

Telecommunication operators are struggling to adopt and scale cloud native technologies. To address this, the Cloud Native Telecommunications Forum (CNTF) was established. The industry is urged to move towards cloud native solutions to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and quicken market delivery. Achieving this requires cooperation across the ecosystem—including operators, vendors, and hyperscalers—with emphasis on simplifying operations through CI/CD/CT and ISSU, increasing automation, enhancing resilience, and enabling cost reduction. The CNTF seeks to align the industry through collective action, promoting collaboration between stakeholders to overcome adoption challenges like security risks, migration disruptions, and workforce skill gaps. The forum will rely on organizations like NGMN Alliance and SDOs to set strategic priorities and push for execution, embracing both proprietary and open solutions to support diverse business needs and realize the full potential of cloud native transformation for the telecom sector.
